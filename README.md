# Course Scheduler

A web application for generating university course timetables and schedules, built with Python (Flask) and an attractive, interactive frontend. The app uses a graph coloring algorithm to automatically detect scheduling conflicts and assign optimal time slots for courses, professors, and students.

## How It Works

1. Enter course details (name, professor, student list) directly into the form.
2. Click **Generate Schedule**.
3. The app models conflicts and uses a greedy graph coloring algorithm to assign time slots.
4. View your optimized timetable on the results dashboard.
